# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
This is a project I worked on for Lighthouse Labs to learn back end development with provided ejs templates, for which I had to implement the necessary logic.
